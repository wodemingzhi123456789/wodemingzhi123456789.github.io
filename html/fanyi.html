            <h1> 机翻：Alain Badiou: A Pseudo-Maoist Obscurantist</h1>
            <p>
                [This is the draft of a section from my book in progress entitled The Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Class Interest Theory of Ethics. This section (12.10) comes from the chapter on “Pseudo-Marxist Ethical Theories”. Comments and criticisms are welcome! —S.H. (3/1/08)]
            </p>
            <p>
                [这是我正在撰写的题为《马克思列宁毛泽东主义阶级利益理论的伦理学》一书中的一节草稿。本节（12.10）来自 "伪马克思主义伦理理论 "一章。欢迎大家提出意见和批评!-S.H. (3/1/08)]
            </p>
    <p>Back in section 2.1 of this book I quoted Marx and Engels on the philosophy of their era. They remarked that “German philosophy is a consequence of German petty-bourgeois conditions” and that “the philosophers have only to dissolve their language into the ordinary language, from which it is abstracted, in order to recognize it as the distorted language of the actual world”. Contemporary philosophy largely fits this description as well, especially European “Continental Philosophy”, and most especially recent and contemporary French philosophy.</p>
    <p>
        早在本书第2.1节中，我引用了马克思和恩格斯关于他们那个时代的哲学的观点。他们说，"德国哲学是德国小资产阶级条件的结果"，"哲学家们只要把他们的语言溶入普通语言，从普通语言中抽象出来，就能认识到它是扭曲了实际世界的语言"。当代哲学在很大程度上也符合这一描述，特别是欧洲的 "大陆哲学"，尤其是最近和当代的法国哲学。
    </p>

    <p>
        Recent French philosophy is extremely difficult to understand for those who have not been carefully schooled (indoctrinated?) in it, because it consists almost entirely of comments couched in a special “philosophical language”. That language is not French, and it is not English or any other natural language. It is a “language” which systematically uses many French words in quite bizarre ways. These words do not mean what they normally do in ordinary French, and when they are translated into English they do not mean what they normally do in ordinary English.1 In this milieu words like „truth‟ and even words that are generally considered less philosophically problematic, such as „event‟, „subject‟, „situation‟, „fidelity‟, „void‟, „state‟, „address‟, „project‟,
„singularity‟, and—it seems—endless others, all have strange and obscure meanings—even after they are supposedly “defined”! On top of this, weird special coinages are frequently introduced such as „the Other‟, „alterity‟, „evental‟, etc. Actually, it is even worse than that: Each French philosopher has his or her own philosophical language, though generally it is related in some family-resemblance sort of way to the other recent French philosophical languages, with some considerable similarities in the use of many particular philosophical terms. And all these “philosophical languages” are both extremely abstract and bizarre in the extreme. The more divorced they are from ordinary language and ordinary existence, the more their authors seem to like them. They are all deeply obscurantist in their effect, whether or not that is the intention of their proponents (as I strongly suspect that it is!).

    </p>
    <p>
        最近的法国哲学对于那些没有经过认真学习（灌输）的人来说是非常难以理解的，因为它几乎完全由用一种特殊的 "哲学语言 "表述的评论组成。这种语言不是法语，也不是英语或任何其他自然语言。这是一种 "语言"，它系统地以相当奇怪的方式使用许多法语词汇。这些词在普通法语中的意思并不一样，而当它们被翻译成英语时，它们在普通英语中的意思也不一样。1在这个环境中，像 "真理 "这样的词，甚至像 "事件"、"主体"、"情况"、"忠实"、"空虚"、"状态"、"地址"、"项目 "、"奇异性"这样被普遍认为在哲学上问题不大的词，
，以及似乎无穷无尽的其他词语，都有奇怪和晦涩的含义--即使在它们被假定为 "定义 "之后！此外，还经常引入奇怪的特殊术语，如 "他者"、"改变"、"最终 "等！除此之外，还经常引入一些奇怪的特殊术语，如 "其他"、"改变"、"演变 "等等。事实上，情况甚至比这更糟：每个法国哲学家都有他或她自己的哲学语言，尽管一般来说，它以某种家族相似的方式与其他最近的法国哲学语言相关，在许多特殊的哲学术语的使用上有一些相当的相似性。而所有这些 "哲学语言 "都是极端抽象和怪异的。它们越是脱离普通语言和普通存在，它们的作者似乎就越喜欢它们。它们在效果上都是深深的蒙昧主义，无论这是否是其支持者的意图（我强烈怀疑是这样的！）。

        Engels remarks in his Dialectics of Nature that Philosophical expositions which cannot be grasped by every educated person do not, in our opinion, deserve the printer‟s ink expended on them. What has been clearly thought out can also be said clearly and without circumlocution. The philosophical evils which disfigure the writings of the erudite seem to aim more at concealing thoughts than at revealing them.2
    </p>
    <p>
        恩格斯在《自然辩证法》中指出，我们认为，每个受过教育的人都无法掌握的哲学论述，不值得在上面花费印刷厂的油墨。思考清楚的东西也可以说得清楚，不需要拐弯抹角。破坏博学者著作的哲学弊端似乎更多的是为了掩盖思想，而不是为了揭示它们。
    </p>
    <p>
        Personally, like Engels, I despise this whole approach to philosophy, of the sort that contemporary French philosophy typifies, and I really have no wish to even bother with it at all. However, there is one character, Alain Badiou, who I have to bother with briefly because he has in the past called himself a “Maoist” and is now often called a “Post-Maoist” or at least is still supposed to have some sort of “association” with Maoism3, and because he has written a book on “ethics” which has been translated into English as Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil.4 Given my general lack of familiarity with recent French philosophy and my strong hostility to it, and given its obscurantist nature, it is very unlikely that I have fully understood all of what 
Badiou is trying to say in this book. Nevertheless, I gave it a serious attempt, and this is my report on it.

    </p>
    <p>
        The first thing to note here is the complete absence of any class content in Badiou‟s conception and analysis of morality or ethics (he draws no distinction between the two5). Thus, in the whole first part of the book where he criticizes what I would call the “bourgeois conception of human rights”, he never once calls it bourgeois or identifies it as an aspect of bourgeois morality or ideology. Instead of attacking bourgeois morality, and promoting an alternative proletarian morality, he seems to be attacking merely one abstract conception of ethics (relating to just the narrow sphere of the prevailing establishment notion of human rights) while saying that he is opposed to all ethics in general.
    </p>
    <p>
        首先要注意的是，在巴迪欧对道德或伦理的概念和分析中，完全没有任何阶级内容（他没有区分这两者 ）。因此，在本书的整个第一部分中，他批评了我称之为 "资产阶级人权概念 "的东西，但他从未称其为资产阶级，或将其认定为资产阶级道德或意识形态的一个方面。他不是在攻击资产阶级道德，并提倡另一种无产阶级道德，而是似乎只是在攻击一种抽象的道德概念（只与普遍存在的人权概念的狭窄领域有关），同时说他反对所有一般的道德规范。
    </p>
    <p>
        Badiou states on p. 9 that one presupposition of the “ethic of human rights” that he is criticizing is that it posits “a general human subject, such that whatever evil befalls him is universally identifiable…” At that early point in the book, I thought, “Well, good; he may be criticizing the bourgeoisie here for its classless view of the „human subject‟.” But that isn‟t what he meant here. Nowhere does he try to bring out the obvious fact that different classes have different conceptions of what is right or wrong!
    </p>
    <p>
        巴迪欧在第9页上说，他所批评的 "人权伦理 "的一个预设是它假定 "一个普遍的人类主体，这样，无论他遭遇什么邪恶，都是可以普遍识别的......"在这本书的早期，我想，"嗯，不错；他可能是在批评资产阶级对 "人类主体 "的无阶级观点。但这并不是他在这里的意思。他在任何地方都没有试图指出一个明显的事实，即不同的阶级对什么是正确的或错误的有不同的概念!
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, in an interview which is included as an appendix to the book, Badiou describes how he and his supposedly “Maoist” or “Post-Maoist” circle of friends have actually turned away from having a class perspective generally:
    </p>
    <p>
        事实上，在作为本书附录的一次采访中，巴迪欧描述了他和他所谓的 "毛主义 "或 "后毛主义 "的朋友圈实际上已经远离了一般的阶级观点：
    </p>
    <p>
        The second thing that has changed over these last twenty years concerns the status of class. For a long time we were faithful to the idea of a class politics, a class state, and so on. Today we think that political initiatives which present themselves as representations of a class have given everything they had to give. The Marxist analysis of classes remains a fully reliable tool. I think that global trends have essentially confirmed some of Marx‟s fundamental intuitions. There is no going back on this; there is no need for a revision of Marxism itself. It is a matter of going beyond the idea that politics represents objective groups that can be designated as classes. This idea has had its power and importance. But in our opinion, we cannot today begin from or set out from this idea. We can begin from political processes, from political oppositions, from conflicts and contradictions, obviously. But it is no longer possible to code these phenomena in terms of representations of classes. In other words, emancipatory politics or reactionary politics may exist, but they cannot be rendered immediately transitive to a scientific, objective study of how class functions in society.
    </p>
    <p>
        过去二十年来发生的第二件事是关于阶级的地位。长期以来，我们一直忠实于阶级政治、阶级国家等理念。今天我们认为，以阶级代表自居的政治举措已经付出了他们所要付出的一切。马克思主义的阶级分析仍然是一个完全可靠的工具。我认为，全球趋势基本上已经证实了马克思的一些基本直觉。在这一点上没有回头路可走；没有必要对马克思主义本身进行修订。这是一个超越政治代表可以被指定为阶级的客观群体的想法的问题。这种想法有它的力量和重要性。但在我们看来，我们今天不能从这个想法开始或出发。我们可以从政治进程、政治对立、冲突和矛盾开始，显然。但不再可能用阶级的表征来对这些现象进行编码。换句话说，解放的政治或反动的政治可能存在，但它们不能被立即转化为对阶级如何在社会中发挥作用的科学、客观的研究。
    </p>
    <p>
        This opposition to viewing things from a class perspective is apparent in Badiou‟s other works as well, and in his philosophy even more than in his politics. In Badiou‟s essay “One Divides into Two”7, he launches into his subject (whatever that is, exactly!) with the remark that “Today, Lenin‟s political works are being entirely revisited through the canonical opposition between democracy and totalitarian dictatorship.” My friend, Jerry Leonard, in the course of criticizing that essay and the rest of Badiou‟s book Century, comments:
    </p>
<p>
    这种反对从阶级角度看问题的观点在巴迪欧的其他作品中也很明显，在他的哲学中甚至比在他的政治中更明显。在巴迪欧的文章《一分为二》中，他以一句话进入他的主题（不管那是什么，确切地说！）："今天，列宁的政治作品通过民主和极权主义独裁之间的经典对立被完全重新审视。"我的朋友，Jerry Leonard，在批评这篇文章和Badiou的《世纪》一书的其他部分时：
</p>
<p>
    Badiou can‟t say who or what is “revisiting” Lenin because this is the trademark, this is the hallmark of the bourgeoisie as a class which must represent itself anonymously, as if, in this case, it means the same thing for Lenin to be “entirely revisited” by reactionaries as by revolutionaries. He can‟t address this question in a Marxist way, that is, because to present this question in a Marxist way would mean that he would have to say, he would have to seriously analyze, how such a “revisitation” involves a renewed “looking at things” from the viewpoint and from the position of a definite class of “today”.
</p>
<p>
    巴迪欧不能说谁或什么在 "重温 "列宁，因为这是资产阶级的标志，这是资产阶级作为一个必须匿名代表自己的阶级的标志，好像在这种情况下，列宁被反动派 "完全重温 "和被革命者重温是同样的意思。他不能以马克思主义的方式解决这个问题，也就是说，以马克思主义的方式提出这个问题就意味着他必须说，他必须认真分析，这种 "重新审视 "是如何从 "今天 "的某个阶级的观点和立场出发，重新 "看待事物"。
</p>
<p>
    There is no such thing—except in the liberal political imagination—in class society, “today” or at any other time in history, as a “revisitation” of anything from a point of view, from a frame of conceptual reference, which transcends or stands above or outside of class struggle and class antagonism, whether such struggle is recognized self-consciously or not. But Badiou gives away his common liberalism because he thinks that such a “transcendent” position exists, because he keeps silent about it and in effect speaks with the acceptable level of static and distortion for the bourgeoisie in “today‟s” international climate of crisis, where the main question that is indeed being “revisited” by them is how to avoid open class struggle at the level of ideas as well as, most of all, at the level of armed combat.
</p>
<p>
    在阶级社会中，"今天 "或历史上的任何其他时间，都不存在这样的事情--除了在自由主义的政治想象中，从一个观点、从一个概念参考框架来 "重温 "任何东西，它超越或站在阶级斗争和阶级对立之上或之外，不管这种斗争是否被自觉地承认。但巴迪欧放弃了他的普通自由主义，因为他认为这样的 "超越 "立场是存在的，因为他对此保持沉默，实际上是在 "今天 "的国际危机气氛中以资产阶级可以接受的静态和扭曲的方式说话，在那里他们确实正在 "重新审视 "的主要问题是如何在思想层面以及最重要的是在武装斗争层面避免公开阶级斗争。
</p>
<p>
    That‟s a very perceptive criticism of not only Badiou, but of liberal bourgeois ideologists in general! One of the best ways to spot a bourgeois “radical-liberal” who has insinuated himself into the nominally MLM movement is by his avoidance and even outright rejection of expressing his views from a class perspective. And in Badiou‟s case that is true not only for his remarks about Lenin‟s struggle against Kautsky, but also for his whole conception of ethics. In Badiou‟s Ethics, “class” is a concept which is notable only because it is completely absent from the picture!

</p>
<p>
    这不仅是对巴迪欧的批评，也是对一般自由派资产阶级思想家的批评，非常有见地！发现一个资产阶级 "激进自由主义者 "的最好方法之一，就是他回避甚至直接拒绝从阶级角度来表达他的观点。在巴迪欧的例子中，这不仅适用于他对列宁与考茨基的斗争的评论，也适用于他的整个伦理学概念。在巴迪欧的伦理学中，"阶级 "是一个值得注意的概念，因为它完全没有出现在画面中。
</p>
<p>
    Badiou talks about “interests” to a surprising degree in his short book on ethics. But for him interests (let alone class interests) are not the foundation for ethics. On the contrary, he consistently contrasts people‟s concern about their interests with “any Good” or with ethics as he views it:
</p>
<p>
    巴迪欧在他关于伦理学的短书中谈及 "利益 "的程度令人惊讶。但对他来说，利益（更不用说阶级利益）不是道德的基础。相反，他一直将人们对自身利益的关注与 "任何善 "或他所认为的伦理学进行对比：
</p>
<p>
    In any case, everyone knows this: the routines of survival are indifferent to any Good you might care to mention. Every pursuit of an interest has success as its only source of legitimacy.
</p>
<p>
    在任何情况下，每个人都知道：生存的常规对你可能关心的任何Good都漠不关心。对利益的每一种追求都以成功作为其唯一的合法性来源。
</p>
<p>
    These two brief sentences are very telling. Badiou thinks that the pursuit of interests (even class interests) is unrelated to ethics, and therefore he is totally against all ethics as it is normally understood (and not just a specifically bourgeois ethics)! In his political work he and his small group of associates apparently do concern themselves with the interests of the sans-papiers (undocumented illegal immigrant workers) in amnesty reforms and so forth, and so I suppose we should commend him for concerning himself with interests in politics even if he thinks this has nothing at all to do with morality or what is right or wrong.
</p>
<p>
    这两个简短的句子很能说明问题。巴迪欧认为对利益（甚至是阶级利益）的追求与伦理无关，因此他完全反对通常所理解的所有伦理（而不仅仅是专门的资产阶级伦理）！在他的政治工作中，他和他的小伙伴们显然在特赦中关心无证非法移民工人的利益！在他的政治工作中，他和他的小伙伴们显然确实关心无证非法移民工人（sans-papiers）在大赦改革等方面的利益，因此我想我们应该赞扬他在政治上关心自己的利益，即使他认为这与道德或什么是正确或错误完全无关。
